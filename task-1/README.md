# Task 1

## Skills required
- YAML parsing
- Basic ansible

## Task
Create an ansible playbook which will take a file as input of format type `sample1.yml` and returns files in the following format:
- randomkey1.yml with the value randomvalue1
- randomkey2.yml with the value randomvalue2
- randomkey3.yml with the value randomvalue3

## Considerations
1. The input file sample1.yml can be dynamic in nature and can have as many elements inside the helloworld key
2. Ensure proper usage of variables where deemed necessary
